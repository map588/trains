Control objects are used to control the behavior of the application through the user interface.
These objects will be calling the methods of the subject objects to perform the actual changes.
The subject objects in turn will call the view objects to update the user interface.
Rinse and repeat.

Ordinarily, these would be called "Model", "View" and "Controller" objects,
but I'm using different names to avoid confusion because our objects share the
terms "model" and "controller" with the MVC pattern.
